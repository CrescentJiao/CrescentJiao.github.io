abstract: "Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the accuracy of
  volcanic ash detection using satellite imagery, to improve existing monitoring tools
  to adapt them to the Popocatépetl volcano in Mexico. ~ Theoretical Framework: Volcanic
  ash detection via remote sensing employs Pavolonis' algorithms that compare radiances
  in the thermal and mid-infrared spectrum. This approach differentiates ash from
  clouds and water vapor by leveraging its differential absorption. Satellites such
  as GOES-16, which capture multispectral data, optimize the continuous detection
  and monitoring of ash dispersion, even in areas of low concentration. ~ Method:
  Three volcanic ash detection algorithms were compared using images from the Popocatépetl
  eruption event on May 21, 2023: two developed by Pavolonis, which combine thermal
  and mid-infrared bands, and a third, a spectral adaptation designed to enhance precision
  at the edges of the ash cloud, tailored to the study area. Results were validated
  with an RGB ash image provided by NOAA. ~ Results and Discussion: Pavolonis' algorithms
  provided a solid foundation for general detection, but the third algorithm, specifically
  designed for this study, significantly improved edge detection where classification
  conditions are more complex. This improvement was reflected in a higher agreement
  with the RGB ash image used as a reference. However, limitations related to atmospheric
  interference were identified, which require further adjustments in low ash concentration
  scenarios. ~ Research Implications: The findings of this research have significant
  practical and theoretical implications for volcanic risk management and environmental
  protection. Enhanced accuracy in volcanic ash detection can optimize monitoring
  and early warning strategies, reducing risks to public health and infrastructure.
  ~ Originality/Value: This study contributes to the literature by introducing a specific
  spectral adaptation to improve edge detection of volcanic ash, a novel approach
  not previously addressed. The research's relevance lies in its ability to refine
  monitoring methodology, providing more effective tools for volcanic risk management
  and offering a model applicable to other areas facing similar remote sensing challenges."
