abstract: Lava domes exhibit highly unpredictable and hazardous behavior, which is
  why imaging their morphological evolution to decipher the underlying governing mechanisms
  remains a major challenge. Using high-resolution satellite radar imagery enhanced
  with deep-learning, we image the repetitive dome construction-subsidence cycles
  at Popocatépetl volcano (Mexico) with very high temporal and spatial resolution.
  We show that these cycles resemble gas-driven rise and fall of the upper magma column,
  where buoyant bubble-rich magma is extruded from the conduit (in ~hours-days), and
  successively drained back (in ~days-months) as magma degasses and crystallizes.
  These cycles are superimposed on a progressive decadal crater deepening, accompanied
  by heat and gas flux decrease, which could be partially explained by gas depletion
  within the magma plumbing system. Results reinforce the idea that gas retention
  and escape from the magma column play a key role in the short- and long-term morphological
  evolution of low-viscosity lava domes and their associated hazards.
