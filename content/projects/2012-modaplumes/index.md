**Funding source: European MEMOVOLC Young Researcher travel grant**. 

Project written to bring together expertises of two postdocs studying volcanic plumes with complementary approaches: **Sébastien Valade** (volcanologist/geophysicist working at LMV, France), and **Matteo Cerminara** (physicist working at INGV-Pisa, Italy). 

Two complementary articles on volcanic were published thanks to the exchange:
