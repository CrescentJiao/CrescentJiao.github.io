<!-- Project written to bring together two techniques still underused despite their very high potential, useful to recover key parameters which can reflect changes inside the volcanic system.
1) Changes in the crater morphology of active volcanoes can reflect changing internal conditions of the underlying magmatic system. These processes, characterized by alternating construction and destruction inside the crater, can be detected from space using SAR intensity images, and can sometimes be precursors to paroxysmal activity.
2) Changes in the degassing activity of a volcano can reflect variations in the accumulation/release of pressure in the shallow volcanic system, which often foresee variations in the volcanic activity. These processes can be recorded with arrays of infrasonic sensors deployed nearby the volcano, and quantified/localized using well established algorithms using multichannel semblance.

The unique combination of these two techniques and recovery/analysis of these parameters will improve our ability to understand and forecast eruptions. -->
